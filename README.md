> **Built with AI:** The foundation was scaffolded by [OpenAI Codex](https://openai.com/blog/openai-codex), then the majority of the features, UI, bug fixes, and polish were built collaboratively with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) (Anthropic). Review the code before deploying to production.
